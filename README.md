### Hi there! I am Ty Young ðŸ‘‹

While I am currently a high school student at Dobyns-Bennett, I plan on attending college beginning in the fall of 2021.

I enjoy learning more than anything, as well as collaborating with others. During the remainder of my time at Dobyns-Bennett, I plan to collect necessary skills that will benefit my progress in the Technology Industry.

I am beyond excited to learn more, and I wish that I can even help others along the way.

I hope that all is going well for you, and welcome to my GitHub!
