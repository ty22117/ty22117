### Hi there! I am Ty Young ðŸ‘‹

While I am currently a high school student at Dobyns-Bennet, I plan on attending college beginning in the fall of 2021. 

I enjoy learning more than anything, as well as collabarting with others. During the remainder of my time at Dobyns-Bennett, I hope to collect necessary skills that will benefit my progress in the Technology Industry.

I am beyond excited to learn more, and I hope that I can even helped others along the way.

I hope that all is going well for you, and welcome to my GitHub!
